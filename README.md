#  Memory game

Memory game based on [this tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/vanilla-javascript-tutorial-build-a-memory-game-in-30-minutes-e542c4447eae). Bit more advanced than other stuff I have done before, but very useful learning experience. 

Cat images by me.

## If I had more time / Potential to-dos

* Change jpgs to svgs, to be able to change background colour of cards
* Add number of clicks to complete?
* Add "correct"-colour effect to card? Or animation (pulse?) to show it was correct
* Make game responsive. I can achieve a scaling effect with a float plus height:0, padding-bottom: percentage, but this messes with the shuffle function.
